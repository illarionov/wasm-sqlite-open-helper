# How to Contribute

All types of contributions are encouraged and valued.

If you would like to contribute code to wasm-sqlite-open-helper you can do so through GitHub by forking the
repository and sending a pull request.

Before submitting a PR, get working code in a personal branch with tests passing:

```
./gradlew check styleCheck
```

Please make every effort to follow existing conventions and style in order to keep the code as
readable as possible.

Consult [GitHub Help](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) for more
information on using pull requests.
